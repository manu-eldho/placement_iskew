# Question: A postman needs to deliver mail to houses on a street. Given the capacity C and locations with mail amounts, find the minimum distance to deliver all mail (starting from position 0).

    N, C = map(int, input().split())
    
    positive_locations = []
    negative_locations = []
    
    for _ in range(N):

        if coord > 0:
            positive_locations.append((coord, mail_amount))
        else:
            negative_locations.append((coord, mail_amount))
            
    positive_locations.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)

    current_capacity = 0
    for coord, mail_amount in positive_locations:

            take = min(mail_amount, current_capacity)
